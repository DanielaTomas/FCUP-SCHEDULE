TODO

The proposed system presents a novel application of \ac{mcts} to \ac{ucttp}, combined with \ac{hc} for local improvements. By leveraging interactive recommendations and conflict detection, the tool provides a more effective and adaptive scheduling process for \ac{fcup} and can be extended to other institutions and help in other studies. 

Future work will focus on the diving strategy, refining the heuristic functions and improving computational performance.
