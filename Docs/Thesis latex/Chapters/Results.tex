\label{Results}

This chapter presents the main outcomes of the proposed \ac{mcts}-based system for \ac{cb-ctt}, including its performance, feasibility, and evaluations of enhancements such as the diving strategy.

\section{Feasibility and Performance}

The proposed system consistently produced feasible solutions across all tested configurations.

\section{\(C\) Parameter Behaviour}

The exploration constant \(C\) in the \ac{uct} formula (Formula \ref{uct_formula}) was varied across several orders of magnitude (from 0.1 to 1000), including the modified variant incorporating accumulated rewards (Formula \ref{modified_uct}). Surprisingly, the results showed that varying \(C\) had minimal impact on solution quality, which indicates a lower-than-expected sensitivity to node selection.
