It is perhaps due to this characteristic that in the past decade-or-so, metaheuristics have become increasingly popular in the field of automated timetabling. In this paper we carry out an overview of such applications, paying particular attention to the various methods that have been proposed for dealing and differentiating between constraints of varying importance. Our review allows us to classify these algorithms into three general classes, and we make some instructive comments on each of these.},

	abstract = {Scheduling is one of the problems which so many researches have been conducted on it over the years. The university course timetabling problem which is an NP-hard problem is a type of scheduling problem. Timetabling process must be done for each semester frequently, which is an exhausting and time consuming task. The allocation of whole of events in timeslots and rooms performs by the university course timetabling process considering the list of hard and soft constraints presented in one semester, so that no conﬂict is created in such allocations. In the university course timetabling problem (UCTTP), the hard constraints should not be violated under any conditions; soft constraints also should not be violated as much as possible. The aim of the present paper is to analyze available approaches in the study of university course timetabling problems, including operational researches, metaheuristic methods and intelligent novel methods; also the distributed multi agent systems based approach (Cooperative Search method) is investigated due to its scalability which enables the timetabling of common events between departments. In addition, in this work a complete introduction of reliable datasets has been given to test and evaluation of the structure of considered algorithms.},

	abstract = {The timetabling problem is common to academic institutions such as schools, colleges or universities. It is a very hard combinatorial optimisation problem which attracts the interest of many researchers. The university course timetabling problem (UCTTP) is difficult to address due to the size of the problem and several challenging hard and soft constraints. Over the years, various methodologies were proposed to solve UCTTP. The purpose of this survey paper is to provide the most recent scientific review of the methodologies applied to UCTTP. The paper unveils a classification of methodologies proposed in recent years based on chronology and datasets used. Perspectives, trends, challenges and opportunities in UCTTP are also presented. It is observed that meta-heuristic approaches are popular among researchers. This is followed closely by hybrid methodologies. Hyper-heuristic approaches are also able to produce effective results. Another observation is that the state-of-art methodologies in the scientific literature are not fully utilised in a real-world environment perhaps due to the limited flexibility of these methodologies.},

This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarize the results from the key game and nongame domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents a general methodology for embodying simulation as part of a tree search procedure, as a technique for solving practical problems in combinatorial optimization. Target problems are either difficult to express as mixed integer optimization models, or have models which provide rather loose bounds; in both cases, traditional, exact methods typically fail. The idea then is to have tree search instantiating part of the variables in a systematic way, and for each particular instantiation—i.e., a node in the search tree—resort to a simulation for assigning values to the remaining variables; then, use the outcome of the simulation for evaluating that node in the tree. This method has been used with considerable success in gameplaying, but has received very limited attention as a tool for optimization. Nevertheless, it has great potential, either as a way for improving known heuristics or as an alternative to metaheuristics. We depart from repeated, randomized simulation based on problem-specific heuristics for applications in scheduling, logistics, and packing, and show how the systematic search in a tree improves the results that can be obtained.},

  abstract      = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input–output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},
